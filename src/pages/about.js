    <h2>Hi, I'm Soren.</h2>
    <p>I am a talented web developer with an eye for design and a love for learning.</p>
    <p>I worked for five years doing student and leadership development within Higher Education and two years working for a staffing agency, supporting a large automotive manufactorer in Northern California. Though I loved these jobs and enjoyed building meaningful relationships with clients and coworkers, I had a longing to create, code, and develop.</p>
    <p>I recently took the plunge, left my previous career and dove head first into programming. I have spent the last three months studying and developing at LearningFuze, an accelerated Web Development Program in Orange County. I have been immersed in numerous in-demand technologies and build several applications. I currently have a particular fondness for React, JavaScript and Node. You can see more about my technical skills and recent projects below.</p>
    <p>I would love to work with you on your next project. I bring the technical skills, interpersonal skills, and experience interfacing with clients to be a great asset to your team.</p>
