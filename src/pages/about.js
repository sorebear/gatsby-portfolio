		<p style={styles.textStyle}>
			I am a talented web developer with an eye for design and a love for learning. I love
			developing, coding, and learning any new technology I can get my hands on.
		</p>
		<p  style={styles.textStyle}>
			I worked for five years doing student and leadership development within Higher Education
			and two years working for a staffing agency, supporting a large automotive manufactorer in
			Northern California. Though I loved these jobs and enjoyed building meaningful
			relationships with clients and coworkers, I had a longing to create, code, and develop.
		</p>
		<p style={styles.textStyle}>
			I recently took the plunge, left my previous career and dove head first into programming. I
			have spent the last three months studying and developing at LearningFuze, an accelerated
			Web Development Program in Orange County. I have been immersed in numerous in-demand
			technologies and build several applications. I currently have a particular fondness for
			React, JavaScript and Node. You can see more about my technical skills and recent projects
			below.
		</p>
		<p  style={styles.textStyle}>
			I am now a full-time Web Developer for Envivent, Inc. where I build and maintain CMS
			websites, web applications, custom emails, and more.
		</p>
		<p style={styles.textStyle}>
			I would love to work with you on your next project. I bring the technical skills,
			interpersonal skills, and experience interfacing with clients to be a great asset to your
			team.
		</p>
